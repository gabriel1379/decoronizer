The Icon switch to a prohibitory sign to indicate
as of now (almost) all Websites are DeCoronized.

Confused? The Green sign indicate a inactive Plugin and the crossed sign an Active? Welcome to the World of DeCoronizer!

Anyway ... now (almost) all websites will be Decoronized (unfortunately only in your browser). 
So you miss vitally important messages and a lot of informations are distorted and wrong, just for you. 
The world outside will turn into a madhouse. The plugin can put your life in danger if you believe the informations.

_BUT_

if you are a sensitive person who suffers from bad news more than normal people, 
this plungin will be your salvation..

_IS THIS ALL DAVE? NO JIM ...._

As a special bonus, Twitter becomes useless for you. Just for this feature this plugin is worthwhile.
