DeCoronizer is a Chrome Extension that socially distances you from corona virus and fixes websites.

## Why?

Just for fun.

## Download

(URL to PluginStore)

## Usage

After the installation you will have a new icon next to the address bar.

By clicking on the icon ...

... you can choose the flavour (Kitty, Dogs, Chuck etc.) 

(image)

... and now (almost) all websites will be Decoronized (unfortunately only in your browser). 
You are distanced from vitally important messages and a lot of informations are distorted and wrong, just for you. 
The plugin can put your life in danger if you believe the informations - is there really a Chuck Norrisvirus? Or is it a bunnyvirus? Who knows?

BUT

If you are a sensitive person who suffers from bad news more than normal people, this extension will be your salvation.

IS THAT ALL DAVE? NO, JIM ...

As a special bonus, Twitter becomes utterly useless for you.
