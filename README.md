By clicking on the icon ...

... you can choose the flavour (Kitty, Dogs, Chuck etc.)

... and now (almost) all websites will be Decoronized (unfortunately only in your browser). 
So you miss vitally important messages and a lot of informations are distorted and wrong, just for you. 
The world outside will turn into a madhouse. The plugin can put your life in danger if you believe the informations.

BUT

if you are a sensitive person who suffers from bad news more than normal people, 
this plungin will be your salvation..

IS THATS ALL DAVE? NO JIM ....

As a special bonus, Twitter becomes useless for you. Just for this feature this plugin is worthwhile.
